# snippet-org-mode

A library of yasnippet snippets for org-mode. Install where you store your user generated snippets for the yasnippet package. This is usually in `~/.emacs.d/snippets/org-mode`.

## latex-env-

The snippets with the `latex-env` prefix are snippets for creating LaTeX environments insdie of org.
Org will send these to the LaTeX compiler upon export to PDF.

The `mintin*` snippets are preset with the corresponding language parameter for the `\mintinline{}{}` command.
This is not an environment, but I included this group of snippets to save space in the yasnippet pulldown menu.
